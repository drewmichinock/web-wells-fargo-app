# Wells Fargo App Landing Page

I already created a mock Wells Fargo app for the iPhone. Then I created an emailer to promote and feature the new app. I thought it was only appropriate to create a one-page responsive landing page to where visitors could download the app and see some of the app's features in screenshots.

I followed the Wells Fargo brand guidelines as much as I could. I also tried to incorporate new design patterns and tools that I hadn't seen Wells Fargo use before, like the Bootstrap responsive framework. So I used Bootstrap along with the Simple Line Icons site because they had the best icons I could find the showcase the app's features.
